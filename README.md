## Resumable git clone

Clone a large repo without retrying again and again.

## how to use

1, clone this repo or just download the rgit.sh file into your pc
2,`./rgit.sh [git repo url]`
3, sip tee

you can also put `rgit.sh` to your $PATH dir, so you don't need to open this repo to call this command
